	abstract = {Lethal mutagenesis, or virus extinction produced by enhanced mutation rates, is under investigation as an antiviral strategy that aims at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies, and avoiding selection of antiviral-escape mutants. To explore lethal mutagenesis of hepatitis C virus (HCV), it is important to establish whether ribavirin, the purine nucleoside analogue used in anti-HCV therapy, acts as a mutagenic agent during virus replication in cell culture. Here we report the effect of ribavirin during serial passages of HCV in human hepatoma Huh-7.5 cells, regarding viral progeny production and complexity of mutant spectra. Ribavirin produced an increase of mutant spectrum complexity and of the transition types associated with ribavirin mutagenesis, resulting in HCV extinction. Ribavirin-mediated depletion of intracellular GTP was not the major contributory factor to mutagenesis since mycophenolic acid evoked a similar decrease in GTP without an increase in mutant spectrum complexity. The intracellular concentration of the other nucleoside-triphosphates was elevated as a result of ribavirin treatment. Mycophenolic acid extinguished HCV without an intervening mutagenic activity. Ribavirin-mediated, but not mycophenolic acid-mediated, extinction of HCV occurred via a decrease of specific infectivity, a feature typical of lethal mutagenesis. We discuss some possibilities to explain disparate results on ribavirin mutagenesis of HCV.},

Most patients were children living in rural areas with frequent exposure to domesticated animals and wildlife.Specimens were further studied with universal and species-specific CoV and CCoV 1-step RT-PCR assays, and viral isolation was performed in A72 canine cells. Complete genome sequencing was conducted using the Sanger method.Two of 8 specimens contained sufficient amounts of CCoVs as confirmed by less-sensitive single-step RT-PCR assays, and 1 specimen demonstrated cytopathic effects in A72 cells. Complete genome sequencing of the virus causing cytopathic effects identified it as a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus (genotype II) that we named CCoV–human pneumonia (HuPn)–2018. Most of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 genome is more closely related to a CCoV TN-449, while its S gene shared significantly higher sequence identity with CCoV-UCD-1 (S1 domain) and a feline CoV WSU 79-1683 (S2 domain). CCoV-HuPn-2018 is unique for a 36-nucleotide (12–amino acid) deletion in the N protein and the presence of full-length and truncated 7b nonstructural protein, which may have clinical relevance.This is the first report of a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus isolated from a human patient with pneumonia. If confirmed as a pathogen, it may represent the eighth unique coronavirus known to cause disease in humans. Our findings underscore the public health threat of animal CoVs and a need to conduct better surveillance for them.},

	abstract = {Geminiviruses are devastating viruses of plants that possess single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) DNA genomes. Despite the importance of this class of phytopathogen, there have been no estimates of the rate of nucleotide substitution in the geminiviruses. We report here the evolutionary rate of the tomato yellow leaf curl disease-causing viruses, an intensively studied group of monopartite begomoviruses. Sequences from GenBank, isolated from diseased plants between 1988 and 2006, were analyzed using Bayesian coalescent methods. The mean genomic substitution rate was estimated to be 2.88 x 10(-4) nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year), although this rate could be confounded by frequent recombination within Tomato yellow leaf curl virus genomes. A recombinant-free data set comprising the coat protein (V1) gene in isolation yielded a similar mean rate (4.63 x 10(-4) subs/site/year), validating the order of magnitude of genomic substitution rate for protein-coding regions. The intergenic region, which is known to be more variable, was found to evolve even more rapidly, with a mean substitution rate of approximately 1.56 x 10(-3) subs/site/year. Notably, these substitution rates, the first reported for a plant DNA virus, are in line with those estimated previously for mammalian ssDNA viruses and RNA viruses. Our results therefore suggest that the high evolutionary rate of the geminiviruses is not primarily due to frequent recombination and may explain their ability to emerge in novel hosts.},

The protein is a minor virion structural component that plays an important, not fully understood role in virus production. It was recently demonstrated that the protein forms ion channels. We investigated the importance of the hydrophobic domain of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 E protein. Alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis was used to examine the effect of disruption of the domain on virus production in the context of the virus genome by using a MHV A59 infectious clone. Mutant viruses exhibited smaller plaque phenotypes, and virus production was significantly crippled. Analysis of recovered viruses suggested that the structure of the presumed alpha-helical structure and positioning of polar hydrophilic residues within the predicted transmembrane domain are important for virus production. Generation of viruses with restored wild-type helical pitch resulted in increased virus production, but some exhibited decreased virus release. Viruses with the restored helical pitch were more sensitive to treatment with the ion channel inhibitor hexamethylene amiloride than were the more crippled parental viruses with the single alanine insertions, suggesting that disruption of the transmembrane domain affects the functional activity of the protein. Overall the results indicate that the transmembrane domain plays a crucial role during biogenesis of virions.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus entry is mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The 180-kDa oligomeric S protein of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is posttranslationally cleaved into an S1 receptor binding unit and an S2 membrane fusion unit. The latter is thought to contain an internal fusion peptide and has two 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions designated HR1 and HR2. HR2 is located close to the membrane anchor, and HR1 is some 170 amino acids (aa) upstream of it. Heptad repeat (HR) regions are found in fusion proteins of many different viruses and form an important characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins. We investigated the role of these regions in coronavirus membrane fusion. Peptides HR1 (96 aa) and HR2 (39 aa), corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 regions, were produced in Escherichia coli. When mixed together, the two peptides were found to assemble into an extremely stable oligomeric complex. Both on their own and within the complex, the peptides were highly alpha helical. Electron microscopic analysis of the complex revealed a rod-like structure approximately 14.5 nm in length. Limited proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry indicated that HR1 and HR2 occur in the complex in an antiparallel fashion. In the native protein, such a conformation would bring the proposed fusion peptide, located in the N-terminal domain of HR1, and the transmembrane anchor into close proximity. Using biological assays, the HR2 peptide was shown to be a potent inhibitor of virus entry into the cell, as well as of cell-cell fusion. Both biochemical and functional data show that the coronavirus spike protein is a class I viral fusion protein.},

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes two S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase) which sequentially methylate the RNA cap at guanosine-N7 and ribose 2′-O positions, catalyzed by nsp14 N7-MTase and nsp16 2′-O-MTase, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its MTase activity. Here we report the biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV 2′-O-MTase and the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM. We found that SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast with nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We demonstrated that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both m7GpppA-RNA substrate and SAM cofactor. Structural analysis revealed that nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1∶1 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anti-coronavirus drugs.},

	abstract = {The replication/transcription complex of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is composed of at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–16) encoded by the ORF-1a/1b. This complex includes replication enzymes commonly found in positive-strand RNA viruses, but also a set of RNA-processing activities unique to some nidoviruses. The nsp14 protein carries both exoribonuclease (ExoN) and (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. The nsp14 ExoN activity ensures a yet-uncharacterized function in the virus life cycle and must be regulated to avoid nonspecific RNA degradation. In this work, we show that the association of nsp10 with nsp14 stimulates {\textgreater}35-fold the ExoN activity of the latter while playing no effect on N7-MTase activity. Nsp10 mutants unable to interact with nsp14 are not proficient for ExoN activation. The nsp10/nsp14 complex hydrolyzes double-stranded RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction as well as a single mismatched nucleotide at the 3′-end mimicking an erroneous replication product. In contrast, di-, tri-, and longer unpaired ribonucleotide stretches, as well as 3′-modified RNAs, resist nsp10/nsp14-mediated excision. In addition to the activation of nsp16-mediated 2′-O-MTase activity, nsp10 also activates nsp14 in an RNA processing function potentially connected to a replicative mismatch repair mechanism.},

	abstract = {In this review we explore the regulation of mRNA cap formation and its impact on mammalian cells. The mRNA cap is a highly methylated modification of the 5′ end of RNA pol II-transcribed RNA. It protects RNA from degradation, recruits complexes involved in RNA processing, export and translation initiation, and marks cellular mRNA as “self” to avoid recognition by the innate immune system. The mRNA cap can be viewed as a unique mark which selects RNA pol II transcripts for specific processing and translation. Over recent years, examples of regulation of mRNA cap formation have emerged, induced by oncogenes, developmental pathways and during the cell cycle. These signalling pathways regulate the rate and extent of mRNA cap formation, resulting in changes in gene expression, cell physiology and cell function.,

CoVs code for nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme carrying RNA cap guanine N7-methyltransferase (MTase) and 3′-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) activities. ExoN excises nucleotide mismatches at the RNA 3′-end in vitro, and its inactivation in vivo jeopardizes viral genetic stability. Here, we demonstrate for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV an RNA synthesis and proofreading pathway through association of nsp14 with the low-fidelity nsp12 viral RNA polymerase. Through this pathway, the antiviral compound ribavirin 5′-monophosphate is significantly incorporated but also readily excised from RNA, which may explain its limited efficacy in vivo. The crystal structure at 3.38 Å resolution of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its cofactor nsp10 adds to the uniqueness of CoVs among RNA viruses: The MTase domain presents a new fold that differs sharply from the canonical Rossmann fold.},

          , 
            
              Viruses depend on the host cell to carry out much of their replication, with each offering only a few virus-specific targets for the development of antiviral therapies. This makes the development of broadly active antivirals difficult to conceptualize. Numerous RNA viruses—including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus—have led to recent epidemics, highlighting the need for effective antiviral drugs that can be enlisted quickly. Some years ago, a broadly applicable antiviral strategy was proposed in which a slight increase in the error rate of a rapidly replicating RNA virus would overwhelm the capacity to remove deleterious mutations, driving the viral population to extinction; this strategy is called lethal mutagenesis (
              
                1
              
              ). Although the antivirals ribavirin and favipiravir were developed with this strategy in mind, the recent development of the much more potent molnupiravir to treat SARS-CoV-2 highlights the unknown risks to the host that this strategy entails.},

	abstract = {Lethal mutagenesis is an antiviral therapy that relies on increasing the viral mutation rate with mutagenic nucleoside or base analogues. Currently, the molecular mechanisms that lead to virus extinction through enhanced mutagenesis are not fully understood. Increasing experimental evidence supports the lethal defection model of lethal mutagenesis of RNA viruses, where replication-competent-defectors drive infective virus towards extinction. Here, we address lethal mutagenesis in vivo using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) during the establishment of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) systemic infections in N. tabacum. The results show that 5-FU decreased the infectivity of TMV without affecting its viral load. Analysis of molecular clones spanning two genomic regions showed an increase of the FU-related base transitions A → G and U → C. Although the mutation frequency or the number of mutations per molecule did not increase, the complexity of the mutant spectra and the distribution of the mutations were altered. Overall, our results suggest that 5-FU antiviral effect on TMV is associated with the perturbation of the mutation-selection balance in the genomic region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our work supports the lethal defection model for lethal mutagenesis in vivo in a plant RNA virus and opens the way to study lethal mutagens in plant-virus systems.},

	abstract = {The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is the defining structural feature of eukaryotic mRNAs. Most eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. In this report, we used a yeast genetic system to functionally screen for the cap-forming enzymes encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and identified the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of SARS coronavirus as a (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in vivo in yeast cells and in vitro using purified enzymes and RNA substrates. Interestingly, coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease, and by mutational analysis, we mapped the N7-MTase domain to the carboxy-terminal part of nsp14 that shows features conserved with cellular N7-MTase in structure-based sequence alignment. The exoribonuclease active site was dispensable but the exoribonuclease domain was required for N7-MTase activity. Such combination of the 2 functional domains in coronavirus nsp14 suggests that it may represent a novel form of RNA-processing enzymes. Mutational analysis in a replicon system showed that the N7-MTase activity was important for SARS virus replication/transcription and can thus be used as an attractive drug target to develop antivirals for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS virus. Furthermore, the observation that the N7-MTase of RNA life could function in lieu of that in DNA life provides interesting evolutionary insight and practical possibilities in antiviral drug screening.},

	abstract = {The ongoing coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Understanding the immunological and pathological processes of coronavirus diseases is crucial for the rational design of effective vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. Previous studies showed that 2′-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap structure is required to prevent the recognition of viral RNAs by intracellular innate sensors. Here, we demonstrate that the guanine N7-methylation of the 5′ cap mediated by coronavirus nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) contributes to viral evasion of the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated immune response and pathogenesis in mice. A Y414A substitution in nsp14 of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) significantly decreased N7-methyltransferase activity and reduced guanine N7-methylation of the 5′ cap in vitro. Infection of myeloid cells with recombinant MHV harboring the nsp14-Y414A mutation (rMHVnsp14-Y414A) resulted in upregulated expression of IFN-I and ISG15 mainly via MDA5 signaling and in reduced viral replication compared to that of wild-type rMHV. rMHVnsp14-Y414A replicated to lower titers in livers and brains and exhibited an attenuated phenotype in mice. This attenuated phenotype was IFN-I dependent because the virulence of the rMHVnsp14-Y414A mutant was restored in Ifnar−/− mice. We further found that the comparable mutation (Y420A) in SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 (rSARS-CoV-2nsp14-Y420A) also significantly decreased N7-methyltransferase activity in vitro, and the mutant virus was attenuated in K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice. Moreover, infection with rSARS-CoV-2nsp14-Y420A conferred complete protection against subsequent and otherwise lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, indicating the vaccine potential of this mutant.
IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, use several strategies to evade the host innate immune responses. While the cap structure of RNA, including CoV RNA, is important for translation, previous studies indicate that the cap also contributes to viral evasion from the host immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the N7-methylated cap structure of CoV RNA is pivotal for virus immunoevasion. Using recombinant MHV and SARS-CoV-2 encoding an inactive N7-methyltransferase, we demonstrate that these mutant viruses are highly attenuated in vivo and that attenuation is apparent at very early times after infection. Virulence is restored in mice lacking interferon signaling. Further, we show that infection with virus defective in N7-methylation protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the N7-methylase might be a useful target in drug and vaccine development.},

Here, we show that the CoV replicative machinery, unlike that of other RNA viruses, also uses an exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, which is associated with nonstructural protein (nsp) 14. Bacterially expressed forms of SARS-CoV nsp14 were shown to act on both ssRNAs and dsRNAs in a 3′→5′ direction. The activity depended on residues that are conserved in the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. The protein did not hydrolyze DNA or ribose-2′-O-methylated RNA substrates and required divalent metal ions for activity. A range of 5′-labeled ssRNA substrates were processed to final products of ≈8–12 nucleotides. When part of dsRNA or in the presence of nonlabeled dsRNA, the 5′-labeled RNA substrates were processed to significantly smaller products, indicating that binding to dsRNA in cis or trans modulates the exonucleolytic activity of nsp14. Characterization of human CoV 229E ExoN active-site mutants revealed severe defects in viral RNA synthesis, and no viable virus could be recovered. Besides strongly reduced genome replication, specific defects in sg RNA synthesis, such as aberrant sizes of specific sg RNAs and changes in the molar ratios between individual sg RNA species, were observed. Taken together, the study identifies an RNA virus ExoN activity that is involved in the synthesis of multiple RNAs from the exceptionally large genomic RNA templates of CoVs.},

Here, we critically review over 40 original studies and establish criteria to facilitate comparative analyses. The mutation rates of 23 viruses are presented as substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) and corrected for selection bias where necessary, using a new statistical method. The resulting rates range from 10−8 to10−6 s/n/c for DNA viruses and from 10−6 to 10−4 s/n/c for RNA viruses. Similar to what has been shown previously for DNA viruses, there appears to be a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size among RNA viruses, but this result requires further experimental testing. Contrary to some suggestions, the mutation rate of retroviruses is not lower than that of other RNA viruses. We also show that nucleotide substitutions are on average four times more common than insertions/deletions (indels). Finally, we provide estimates of the mutation rate per nucleotide per strand copying, which tends to be lower than that per cell infection because some viruses undergo several rounds of copying per cell, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses.

The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.

Among the four recognized genera of the family Coronaviridae, human infections reported so far have been limited to alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses3–5. Here we identify porcine deltacoronavirus strains in plasma samples of three Haitian children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Genomic and evolutionary analyses reveal that human infections were the result of at least two independent zoonoses of distinct viral lineages that acquired the same mutational signature in the genes encoding Nsp15 and the spike glycoprotein. In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect the flexibility of the protein and its binding to the host cell receptor. Our findings highlight the potential for evolutionary change and adaptation leading to human infections by coronaviruses outside of the previously recognized human-associated coronavirus groups, particularly in settings where there may be close human–animal contact.},

	abstract = {The current outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 poses unparalleled challenges to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus, one of four genera belonging to the Coronaviridae subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. Coronaviridae, in turn, are members of the order Nidovirales, a group of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Here we present a systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary study based on protein domain architecture, encompassing the entire proteomes of all Orthocoronavirinae, as well as other Nidovirales. This analysis has revealed that the genomic evolution of Nidovirales is associated with extensive gains and losses of protein domains. In Orthocoronavirinae, the sections of the genomes that show the largest divergence in protein domains are found in the proteins encoded in the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein (PP1ab), the spike protein (S), and many of the accessory proteins. The diversity among the accessory proteins is particularly striking, as each subgenus possesses a set of accessory proteins that is almost entirely specific to that subgenus. The only notable exception to this is ORF3b, which is present and orthologous over all Alphacoronaviruses. In contrast, the membrane protein (M), envelope small membrane protein (E), nucleoprotein (N), as well as proteins encoded in the central and carboxy-terminal end of PP1ab (such as the 3C-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and Helicase) show stable domain architectures across all Orthocoronavirinae. This comprehensive analysis of the Coronaviridae domain architecture has important implication for efforts to develop broadly cross-protective coronavirus vaccines.},

	abstract = {The collapse of iconic, keystone populations of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in the Northeast Pacific is of great concern. It is thought that infectious disease may contribute to declines, but little is known about viruses endemic to Pacific salmon. Metatranscriptomic sequencing and surveillance of dead and moribund cultured Chinook salmon revealed a novel arenavirus, reovirus and nidovirus. Sequencing revealed two different arenavirus variants which each infect wild Chinook and sockeye salmon. In situ hybridisation localised arenavirus mostly to blood cells. Population surveys of {\textgreater}6000 wild juvenile Chinook and sockeye salmon showed divergent distributions of viruses, implying different epidemiological processes. The discovery in dead and dying farmed salmon of previously unrecognised viruses that are also widely distributed in wild salmon, emphasizes the potential role that viral disease may play in the population dynamics of wild fish stocks, and the threat that these viruses may pose to aquaculture., Keystone species are animals and plants that play a pivotal role in supporting the ecosystems they live in, making their conservation a high priority. Chinook and sockeye salmon are two such species. These fish play a central role in the coastal ecosystems of the Northeast Pacific, where they have supported Indigenous populations for thousands of years., The last three decades have seen large declines in populations of Chinook and sockeye salmon. One factor that may be involved in these declines is viral infection. In the last ten years, advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of many new viruses, and Mordecai et al. used these technologies to look for new viruses in Pacific salmon., First, Mordecai et al. looked for viruses in dead and dying salmon from farms and discovered three previously unknown viruses. Next, they screened for these viruses in farmed salmon, hatchery salmon and wild salmon to determine their distribution. Two of the viruses were present in fish from the three sources, while one of the viruses was only found in farmed fish. The fact that the three viruses are distributed differently raises questions about how the viruses are transmitted within and between farmed, hatchery and wild salmon populations., These findings will aid salmon-conservation efforts by informing the extent to which these viruses are present in wild salmon populations. Future work will focus on determining the risks these viruses pose to salmon health and investigating the potential for exchange between hatchery, farmed and wild salmon populations. While farmed Pacific salmon may pose some transmission risk to their wild counterparts, they also offer the opportunity to study disease processes that are not readily observable in wild salmon. In turn, such data can be used to develop policies to minimize the impact of these infectious agents and improve the survival of wild salmon populations.},

The newly discovered viruses appear in every family or genus of RNA virus associated with vertebrate infection, including those containing human pathogens such as influenza virus, the Arenaviridae and Filoviridae families, and have branching orders that broadly reflected the phylogenetic history of their hosts. We establish a long evolutionary history for most groups of vertebrate RNA virus, and support this by evaluating evolutionary timescales using dated orthologous endogenous virus elements. We also identify new vertebrate-specific RNA viruses and genome architectures, and re-evaluate the evolution of vector-borne RNA viruses.

	abstract = {Proteins are highly dynamic entities attaining a myriad of different conformations. Protein side chains change their states during dynamics, causing clashes that are propagated at distal sites. A convenient formalism to analyze protein dynamics is based on network theory using Protein Structure Networks (PSNs). Despite their broad applicability, few efforts have been devoted to benchmarking PSN methods and to provide the community with best practices. In many applications, it is convenient to use the centers of mass of the side chains as nodes. It becomes thus critical to evaluate the minimal distance cutoff between the centers of mass which will provide stable network properties. Moreover, when the PSN is derived from a structural ensemble collected by molecular dynamics (MD), the impact of the MD force field has to be evaluated. We selected a dataset of proteins with different fold and size and assessed the two fundamental properties of the PSN, i.e. hubs and connected components. We identified an optimal cutoff of 5 Å that is robust to changes in the force field and the proteins. Our study builds solid foundations for the harmonization and standardization of the PSN approach.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms play a critical role in regulating metabolism, including daily cycles of feeding/fasting. Glucokinase (GCK) is central for whole-body glucose homeostasis and oscillates according to a circadian clock. GCK activators (GKAs) effectively reduce hyperglycemia, but their use is also associated with hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Given the circadian rhythmicity and natural postprandial activation of GCK, we hypothesized that GKA treatment would benefit from being timed specifically during feeding periods. Acute treatment of obese Zucker rats with the GKA AZD1656 robustly increased flux into all major metabolic pathways of glucose disposal, enhancing glucose elimination. Four weeks of continuous AZD1656 treatment of obese Zucker rats improved glycemic control; however, hepatic steatosis and inflammation manifested. In contrast, timing AZD1656 to feeding periods robustly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in addition to improving glycemia, whereas treatment timed to fasting periods caused overall detrimental metabolic effects. Mechanistically, timing AZD1656 to feeding periods diverted newly synthesized lipid toward direct VLDL secretion rather than intrahepatic storage. In line with increased hepatic insulin signaling, timing AZD1656 to feeding resulted in robust activation of AKT, mTOR, and SREBP-1C after glucose loading, pathways known to regulate VLDL secretion and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In conclusion, intermittent AZD1656 treatment timed to feeding periods promotes glucose disposal when needed the most, restores metabolic flexibility and hepatic insulin sensitivity, and thereby avoids hepatic steatosis. Thus, chronotherapeutic approaches may benefit the development of GKAs and other drugs acting on metabolic targets.},

Fourteen putative open reading frames were identified, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. The synthesis of these mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells was confirmed experimentally. The 4382- and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28). A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. Furthermore, together with previously described viral enzymes, they will be important targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of SARS-CoV.},

Lethal mutagenesis is a therapeutic strategy based on the use of mutagens, driving viral populations to extinction. Extinction catastrophe can be experimentally induced by promutagenic nucleosides in cell culture models. The loss of HIV infectivity has been observed after passage in 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine or 5,6-dihydro-5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine while producing a two-fold increase in the viral mutation frequency. Among approved nucleoside analogs, experiments with polioviruses and other RNA viruses suggested that ribavirin can be mutagenic, although its mechanism of action is not clear. Favipiravir and molnupiravir exert an antiviral effect through lethal mutagenesis. Both drugs are broad-spectrum antiviral agents active against RNA viruses. Favipiravir incorporates into viral RNA, affecting the G→A and C→U transition rates. Molnupiravir (a prodrug of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine) has been recently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its triphosphate derivative can be incorporated into viral RNA and extended by the coronavirus RNA polymerase. Incorrect base pairing and inefﬁcient extension by the polymerase promote mutagenesis by increasing the G→A and C→U transition frequencies. Despite having remarkable antiviral action and resilience to drug resistance, carcinogenic risks and genotoxicity are important concerns limiting their extended use in antiviral therapy.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between 20 and 30 proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle, including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 20-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efﬁciency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? Although experimentally derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over 1 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16’s conformational ensemble to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models, we investigate whether Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.},

The studies showed that aberrant PPIs are associated with various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, targeting PPIs is a direction in treating diseases and an essential strategy for the development of new drugs. In the past few decades, the modulation of PPIs has been recognized as one of the most challenging drug discovery tasks. In recent years, some PPIs modulators have entered clinical studies, some of which been approved for marketing, indicating that the modulators targeting PPIs have broad prospects.

Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified.

            In recent years, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, and its variants, especially those with higher transmissibility and substantial immune evasion, have highlighted the imperative for developing novel therapeutics as sustainable solutions other than vaccination to combat coronaviruses (CoVs). Beside receptor recognition and virus entry, members of the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex are promising targets for designing antivirals. Here, the interacting residues that mediate protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of nsp10 with nsp16 and nsp14 were comprehensively analyzed, and the key residues’ interaction maps, interaction energies, structural networks, and dynamics were investigated. Nsp10 stimulates both nsp14’s exoribonuclease (ExoN) and nsp16’s 2′O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase). Nsp14 ExoN is an RNA proofreading enzyme that supports replication fidelity. Nsp16 2′O-MTase is responsible for the completion of RNA capping to ensure efficient replication and translation and escape from the host cell’s innate immune system. The results of the PPIs analysis proposed crucial information with implications for designing SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. Based on the predicted shared protein–protein interfaces of the nsp16-nsp10 and nsp14-nsp10 interactions, a set of dual-target peptide inhibitors was designed. The designed peptides were evaluated by molecular docking, peptide–protein interaction analysis, and free energy calculations, and then further optimized by in silico saturation mutagenesis. Based on the predicted evolutionary conservation of the interacted target residues among CoVs, the designed peptides have the potential to be developed as dual target pan-coronavirus inhibitors.},

	abstract = {The 5= cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA stability and protein translation. Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2=-O-methyltransferases (2=-O-MTase) to autonomously modify their mRNAs and carry a cap-1 structure (m7GpppNm) at the 5= end, thereby facilitating viral replication and escaping innate immune recognition in host cells. Previous studies showed that the 2=-O-MTase activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) needs to be activated by nsp10, whereas nsp16 of feline coronavirus (FCoV) alone possesses 2=-O-MTase activity (E. Decroly et al., J Virol 82:8071– 8084, 2008, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00407-08; M. Bouvet et al., PLoS Pathog 6:e1000863, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863; E. Decroly et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002059, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002059; Y. Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371 /journal.ppat.1002294). In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2=-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses. Based on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2=-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models. Interestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection. Therefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2=-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential. SARS-CoV encodes the 2=-OMTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity. Our current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2=-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides. We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2=-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice. This work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2=-O-MTase of coronaviruses.},

The nonstructural protein 16 2′-OMTase (nsp16) becomes active when nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) and nsp16 interact. Novel peptide drugs have shown promise in the treatment of numerous diseases and new research has established that nsp10 derived peptides can disrupt viral methyltransferase activity via interaction of nsp16. This study had the goal of opti­ mizing new analogous nsp10 peptides that have the ability to bind nsp16 with equal to or higher affinity than those naturally occurring. The following research demonstrates that in silico molecular simulations can shed light on peptide structures and predict the potential of new peptides to interrupt methyltransferase activity via the nsp10/nsp16 interface. The simulations suggest that misalignments at residues F68, H80, I81, D94, and Y96 or rotation at H80 abrogate MTase function. We develop a new set of peptides based on conserved regions of the nsp10 protein in the Coronaviridae species and test these to known MTase variant values. This results in the prediction that the H80R variant is a solid new candidate for potential new testing. We envision that this new lead is the beginning of a reputable foundation of a new computational method that combats coronaviruses and that is beneficial for new peptide drug development.},

The virus-encoded non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) is a bi-functional enzyme consisting of an exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain and plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Here, we report the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN domain bound to its co-factor nsp10 and show that, compared to the SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp14-full-length complex, SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-ExoN retains an integral exoribonuclease fold and preserves an active configuration in the catalytic center. Analysis of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN interface reveals a footprint in nsp10 extensively overlapping with that observed in the nsp10/nsp16 structure. A marked difference in the co-factor when engaging nsp14 and nsp16 lies in helix-α1′, which is further experimentally ascertained to be involved in nsp14-binding but not in nsp16-engagement. Finally, we also show that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is enzymatically active despite the absence of nsp14-MTase domain. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN functions as an exoribonuclease with both structural and functional integrity.},

Since the first SARS epidemic in 2002–2003, the appreciation of bats as key hosts of zoonotic coronaviruses has advanced rapidly. More than 4,000 coronavirus sequences from 14 bat families have been identified, yet the true diversity of bat coronaviruses is probably much greater. Given that bats are the likely evolutionary source for several human coronaviruses, including strains that cause mild upper respiratory tract disease, their role in historic and future pandemics requires ongoing investigation. We review and integrate information on bat–coronavirus interactions at the molecular, tissue, host and population levels. We identify critical gaps in knowledge of bat coronaviruses, which relate to spillover and pandemic risk, including the pathways to zoonotic spillover, the infection dynamics within bat reservoir hosts, the role of prior adaptation in intermediate hosts for zoonotic transmission and the viral genotypes or traits that predict zoonotic capacity and pandemic potential. Filling these knowledge gaps may help prevent the next pandemic., Bats harbour a multitude of coronaviruses and owing to their diversity and wide distribution are prime reservoir hosts of emerging viruses. Ruiz-Aravena, McKee and colleagues analyse the currently available information on bat coronaviruses and discuss their role in recent and potential future spillovers.},

The two viruses responsible for the outbreaks, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are in the spotlight, and SARS-CoV-2 is the focus of the current fast-paced research. Its foundation was laid down by studies of many corona- and related viruses that collectively form the vast order Nidovirales. Comparative genomics of nidoviruses played a key role in this advancement over more than 30 years. It facilitated the transfer of knowledge from characterized to newly identified viruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as contributed to the dissection of the nidovirus proteome and identification of patterns of variations between different taxonomic groups, from species to families. This review revisits selected cases of protein conservation and variation that define nidoviruses, illustrates the remarkable plasticity of the proteome during nidovirus adaptation, and asks questions at the interface of the proteome and processes that are vital for nidovirus reproduction and could inform the ongoing research of SARS-CoV-2.},

Recent metagenomic studies have identified nido-like virus sequences, particularly those related to the Coronaviridae, in a range of aquatic hosts including fish, amphibians, and reptiles. We sought to identify additional members of the Coronaviridae in both bony and jawless fish through a combination of total RNA sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) and data mining of published RNA sequencing data and from this reveal more of the long-term patterns and processes of coronavirus evolution. Accordingly, we identified a number of divergent viruses that fell within the Letovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae, including those in a jawless fish—the pouched lamprey. By mining fish transcriptome data, we identified additional virus transcripts matching these viruses in bony fish from both marine and freshwater environments. These new viruses retained sequence conservation in the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase across the Coronaviridae but formed a distinct and diverse phylogenetic group. Although there are broad-scale topological similarities between the phylogenies of the major groups of coronaviruses and their vertebrate hosts, the evolutionary relationship of viruses within the Letovirinae does not mirror that of their hosts. For example, the coronavirus found in the pouched lamprey fell within the phylogenetic diversity of bony fish letoviruses, indicative of past host switching events. Hence, despite possessing a phylogenetic history that likely spans the entire history of the vertebrates, coronavirus evolution has been characterised by relatively frequent cross-species transmission, particularly in hosts that reside in aquatic habitats.},

	abstract = {Among RNA viruses, the order Nidovirales stands out for including viruses with the largest RNA genomes currently known. Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.},

Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data.

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696–704), PhyML has been widely used (\&gt;2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira–Hasegawa–like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

	abstract = {The concept of homology lies at the root of evolutionary biology. Since the seminal work of Fitch (1970), three main categories of homology relationships have been defined at the molecular level: orthology, paralogy, and xenology. In brief, if two gene copies arose by duplication they are paralogs, whereas if they arose through speciation they are orthologs. If one of them was transferred from a contemporaneous species, we call them xenologs (Supplementary Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material online, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.87k57; see Gray and Fitch (1983); Fitch (2000)). Indeed, these terms were coined under a phylogenetic framework in which species were represented by single individuals, and as such they have remained very much intact during the last four decades—although particular cases within these categories have received specific names (Mindell and Meyer 2001). However, advances in sequencing technology have changed the field, and it is now very common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and/or multiple individuals per species. In general, such genome-wide data sets not only have unveiled extensive phylogenomic incongruence (Jeffroy et al. 2006; Salichos and Rokas 2013) but have brought back to the spotlight the consideration of how ancestral polymorphisms sort within populations (Edwards 2009). Altogether, phylogenomic data make imperative the explicit distinction between organismal and gene histories.},

            Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping
            
              The development of antiviral drugs that impair SARS-CoV-2 replication or prevent it from evading the host immune system is critical for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The methyltransferase that caps viral mRNAs is a potential target for antiviral therapies because capping both enhances the translation of viral proteins and prevents viral mRNAs from being recognized by the host immune system. Rosas-Lemus
              et al.
              solved crystal structures for the SARS-CoV-2 methyltransferase, the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer, in complex with various combinations of its methyl donor and cap structure substrates, a reaction product, and an inhibitor. Together, these structures suggest potential strategies for developing antiviral therapies by disrupting the formation of the active enzyme complex or blocking its catalytic activity.
            
          , 
            
              There are currently no antiviral therapies specific for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic disease COVID-19. To facilitate structure-based drug design, we conducted an x-ray crystallographic study of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2′-
              O
              -methyltransferase complex, which methylates Cap-0 viral mRNAs to improve viral protein translation and to avoid host immune detection. We determined the structures for nsp16-nsp10 heterodimers bound to the methyl donor
              S
              -adenosylmethionine (SAM), the reaction product
              S
              -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), or the SAH analog sinefungin (SFG). We also solved structures for nsp16-nsp10 in complex with the methylated Cap-0 analog m
              7
              GpppA and either SAM or SAH. Comparative analyses between these structures and published structures for nsp16 from other betacoronaviruses revealed flexible loops in open and closed conformations at the m
              7
              GpppA-binding pocket. Bound sulfates in several of the structures suggested the location of the ribonucleic acid backbone phosphates in the ribonucleotide-binding groove. Additional nucleotide-binding sites were found on the face of the protein opposite the active site. These various sites and the conserved dimer interface could be exploited for the development of antiviral inhibitors.},

	abstract = {Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas −RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.
IMPORTANCE The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.},

Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for largescale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for selecting the most reliable positions in the alignment. These include the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of amino acid similarity and, if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the level of consistency across different alignments. Moreover, trimAl can automatically select the parameters to be used in each speciﬁc alignment so that the signal-to-noise ratio is optimized.},

Although a taxonomy that is based on metagenomic sequence data alone represents a substantial departure from the traditional reliance on phenotypic properties, the development of a robust framework for sequence-based virus taxonomy is indispensable for the comprehensive characterization of the global virome.

            SUMMARY
            Viruses and mobile genetic elements are molecular parasites or symbionts that coevolve with nearly all forms of cellular life. The route of virus replication and protein expression is determined by the viral genome type. Comparison of these routes led to the classification of viruses into seven “Baltimore classes” (BCs) that define the major features of virus reproduction. However, recent phylogenomic studies identified multiple evolutionary connections among viruses within each of the BCs as well as between different classes. Due to the modular organization of virus genomes, these relationships defy simple representation as lines of descent but rather form complex networks. Phylogenetic analyses of virus hallmark genes combined with analyses of gene-sharing networks show that replication modules of five BCs (three classes of RNA viruses and two classes of reverse-transcribing viruses) evolved from a common ancestor that encoded an RNA-directed RNA polymerase or a reverse transcriptase. Bona fide viruses evolved from this ancestor on multiple, independent occasions via the recruitment of distinct cellular proteins as capsid subunits and other structural components of virions. The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are a polyphyletic class, with different groups evolving by recombination between rolling-circle-replicating plasmids, which contributed the replication protein, and positive-sense RNA viruses, which contributed the capsid protein. The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are distributed among several large monophyletic groups and arose via the combination of distinct structural modules with equally diverse replication modules. Phylogenomic analyses reveal the finer structure of evolutionary connections among RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, ssDNA viruses, and large subsets of dsDNA viruses. Taken together, these analyses allow us to outline the global organization of the virus world. Here, we describe the key aspects of this organization and propose a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of viruses.},

Various selﬁsh elements parasitize on all cellular life forms. The relative abundances of different classes of viruses are dramatically different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the great majority of viruses possess double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes, with a substantial minority of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses and only limited presence of RNA viruses. In contrast, in eukaryotes, RNA viruses account for the majority of the virome diversity although ssDNA and dsDNA viruses are common as well. Phylogenomic analysis yields tangible clues for the origins of major classes of eukaryotic viruses and in particular their likely roots in prokaryotes. Speciﬁcally, the ancestral genome of positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes might have been assembled de novo from genes derived from prokaryotic retroelements and bacteria although a primordial origin of this class of viruses cannot be ruled out. Different groups of double-stranded RNA viruses derive either from dsRNA bacteriophages or from positive-strand RNA viruses. The eukaryotic ssDNA viruses apparently evolved via a fusion of genes from prokaryotic rolling circle-replicating plasmids and positive-strand RNA viruses. Different families of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses appear to have originated from speciﬁc groups of bacteriophages on at least two independent occasions. Polintons, the largest known eukaryotic transposons, predicted to also form virus particles, most likely, were the evolutionary intermediates between bacterial tectiviruses and several groups of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses including the proposed order “Megavirales” that unites diverse families of large and giant viruses. Strikingly, evolution of all classes of eukaryotic viruses appears to have involved fusion between structural and replicative gene modules derived from different sources along with additional acquisitions of diverse genes.},

            SUMMARY
            Originally, viruses were defined as miniscule infectious agents that passed through filters that retain even the smallest cells. Subsequently, viruses were considered obligate intracellular parasites whose reproduction depends on their cellular hosts for energy supply and molecular building blocks. However, these features are insufficient to unambiguously define viruses as they are broadly understood today. We outline possible approaches to define viruses and explore the boundaries of the virosphere within the virtual space of replicators and the relationships between viruses and other types of replicators. Regardless of how, exactly, viruses are defined, viruses clearly have evolved on many occasions from nonviral replicators, such as plasmids, by recruiting host proteins to become virion components. Conversely, other types of replicators have repeatedly evolved from viruses. Thus, the virosphere is a dynamic entity with extensive evolutionary traffic across its boundaries. We argue that the virosphere proper, here termed orthovirosphere, consists of a distinct variety of replicators that encode structural proteins encasing the replicators’ genomes, thereby providing protection and facilitating transmission among hosts. Numerous and diverse replicators, such as virus-derived but capsidless RNA and DNA elements, or defective viruses occupy the zone surrounding the orthovirosphere in the virtual replicator space. We define this zone as the perivirosphere. Although intense debates on the nature of certain replicators that adorn the internal and external boundaries of the virosphere will likely continue, we present an operational definition of virus that recently has been accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.},

On the contrary, once broken this epistemological barrier, additional unrelated families of giant viruses such as the Pandoraviruses, the Pithoviruses and most recently Mollivirus, were quickly unraveled, suggesting that an entire chapter of microbiology had been ignored since Pasteur and Ivanovski. In this article, we examine to what extent the giant viruses challenge previous deﬁnitions of viruses, the diversity of forms they could take, and how they might have evolved from extinct ancestral cellular lineages. Inspired by the epistemology of Gaston Bachelard, we will also suggest the reasons for which giant viruses laid hidden in plain sight for more than a century. Finally, we propose a new deﬁnition for “viruses” that paradoxically emphasize the fact that they do not encode a single universally shared macromolecule or biochemical function.},

This process is carried out by two enzymes, non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) containing 2’-Omethyltransferase and NSP14 through its N7 methyltransferase activity, which are essential for the replication of the viral genome as well as evading the host's innate immunity. NSP10 acts as a crucial cofactor and stimulator of NSP14 and NSP16. To further understand the role of NSP10, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of {\textgreater}13 million globally collected whole-genome sequences (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from the Global Initiative Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and compared it with the reference genome Wuhan/WIV04/2019 to identify all currently known variants in NSP10. T12I, T102I, and A104V in NSP10 have been identified as the three most frequent variants and characterized using X-ray crystallography, biophysical assays and enhanced sampling simulations. In contrast to other proteins such as spike and NSP6, NSP10 is significantly less prone to mutation due to its crucial role in replication. The functional effects of the variants were examined for their impact on the binding affinity and stability of both NSP14-NSP10 and NSP16-NSP10 complexes. These results highlight the limited changes induced by variant evolution in NSP10 and reflect on the critical roles NSP10 plays during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. These results also indicate that there is limited capacity for the virus to overcome inhibitors targeting NSP10 via the generation of variants in inhibitor binding pockets.},

Aside from the exonuclease activity, nsp14 methyltransferase domain mediates cap methylation, facilitating translation initiation and protecting viral RNA from recognition by the innate immune sensors. The nsp14 exonuclease activity is modulated by a protein co-factor nsp10. While the nsp10/nsp14 complex structure is available, the mechanistic basis for nsp10-mediated modulation remains unclear in the absence of the nsp14 structure. Here, we provide a crystal structure of nsp14 in an apo-form. Comparative analysis of the apo- and nsp10bound structures explain the modulatory role of the co-factor protein and reveal the allosteric nsp14 control mechanism essential for drug discovery. Further, the ﬂexibility of the N-terminal lid of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nsp14 structure presented in this study rationalizes the recently proposed idea of nsp14/nsp10/nsp16 ternary complex.},

	abstract = {Coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), encode a proofreading exonuclease, nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), that helps ensure replication competence at a low evolutionary rate compared with other RNA viruses. In the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated diverse genomic mutations including in nsp14. Here, to clarify whether amino acid substitutions in nsp14 affect the genomic diversity and evolution of SARSCoV-2, we searched for amino acid substitutions in nature that may interfere with nsp14 function. We found that viruses carrying a proline-to-leucine change at position 203 (P203L) have a high evolutionary rate and that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus with the P203L mutation acquired more diverse genomic mutations than wild-type virus during its replication in hamsters. Our ﬁndings suggest that substitutions, such as P203L, in nsp14 may accelerate the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to virus evolution during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {In the field of drug discovery, many methods of molecular modeling have been employed to study complex biological and chemical systems. Experimental strategies are integrated with computational approaches for the identification, characterization, and development of novel drugs and compounds. In modern drug designing, molecular docking is an approach that explores the confirmation of a ligand within the binding site of a macromolecule. To date, many software and tools for docking have been employed. AutoDock Vina (in UCSF [University of California, San Francisco] Chimera) is one of the computationally fastest and most accurate software employed in docking. In this paper, a sequential demonstration of molecular docking of the ligand fisetin with the target protein Akt has been provided, using AutoDock Vina in UCSF Chimera 1.12. The first step involves target protein ID retrieval from the protein database, the second step involves visualization of the protein structure in UCSF Chimera, the third step involves preparation of the target protein for docking, the fourth step involves preparation of the ligand for docking, the fifth step involves docking of the ligand and the target protein as Mol.2 files in Chimera by using AutoDock Vina, and the final step involves interpretation and analysis of the docking results. By following the guidelines and steps outlined in this paper, researchers with no previous background in bioinformatics research can perform computational docking in an easier and more user-friendly manner.},

In addition, CoV infection may cause inflammation, alter immune and stress responses, and modify the coagulation pathways. The balance between the up- and downregulated genes could explain the pathogenesis caused by these viruses. We review specific aspects of CoV-host interactions. CoV genome replication takes place in the cytoplasm in a membrane-protected microenvironment and may control the cell machinery by locating some of their proteins in the host cell nucleus. CoVs initiate translation by cap-dependent and cap-independent mechanisms. CoV transcription involves a discontinuous RNA synthesis (template switching) during the extension of a negative copy of the subgenomic mRNAs. The requirement for base-pairing during transcription has been formally demonstrated in arteriviruses and CoVs. CoV N proteins have RNA chaperone activity that may help initiate template switching. Both viral and cellular proteins are required for replication and transcription, and the role of selected proteins is addressed.},

	abstract = {A recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) lacking the envelope (E) protein is attenuated in vivo. Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence. Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation. Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays. Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship. Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation. Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence. Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced inflammation.},

We investigated how M structure and organization is related to virus shape and size using cryo-electron microscopy, tomography and statistical analysis. We present evidence that suggests M can adopt two conformations and that membrane curvature is regulated by one M conformer. Elongated M protein is associated with rigidity, clusters of spikes and a relatively narrow range of membrane curvature. In contrast, compact M protein is associated with flexibility and low spike density. Analysis of several types of virus-like particles and virions revealed that S protein, N protein and genomic RNA each help to regulate virion size and variation, presumably through interactions with M. These findings provide insight into how M protein functions to promote virus assembly.},

Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN recruit nsp10/nsp14 into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the N7-CCC to yield cap(0) (7MeGpppA) at 50 end of pre-mRNA. A dimeric form of Cap(0)-RTC observed by cryo-EM suggests an in trans backtracking mechanism for nsp14 ExoN to facilitate proofreading of the RNA in concert with polymerase nsp12.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the causal agent of the current global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order, Nidovirales, with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of coronavirus (CoV) genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, comprising the non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14–nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Our results validate reports that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14–nsp10 complex has RNase activity. Detailed functional characterization reveals nsp14–nsp10 is a versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3′-terminus. Consistent with a role in maintaining viral genome integrity during replication, we find that nsp14–nsp10 activity is enhanced by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RdRp) consisting of nsp12–nsp7–nsp8 (nsp12–7–8) and demonstrate that this stimulation is mediated by nsp8. We propose that the role of nsp14–nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading by purging the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication-terminating aberrations. Using our developed assays, we identify drug and drug-like molecules that inhibit nsp14–nsp10, including the known SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for multifunctional inhibitors in COVID-19 treatment.},

The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Mutation is the basis of adaptation. Yet, most mutations are detrimental, and elevating mutation rates will impair a population's fitness in the short term. The latter realization has led to the concept of lethal mutagenesis for curing viral infections, and work with drugs such as ribavirin has supported this perspective. As yet, there is no formal theory of lethal mutagenesis, although reference is commonly made to Eigen's error catastrophe theory. Here, we propose a theory of lethal mutagenesis. With an obvious parallel to the epidemiological threshold for eradication of a disease, a sufficient condition for lethal mutagenesis is that each viral genotype produces, on average, less than one progeny virus that goes on to infect a new cell. The extinction threshold involves an evolutionary component based on the mutation rate, but it also includes an ecological component, so the threshold cannot be calculated from the mutation rate alone. The genetic evolution of a large population undergoing mutagenesis is independent of whether the population is declining or stable, so there is no runaway accumulation of mutations or genetic signature for lethal mutagenesis that distinguishes it from a level of mutagenesis under which the population is maintained. To detect lethal mutagenesis, accurate measurements of the genome-wide mutation rate and the number of progeny per infected cell that go on to infect new cells are needed. We discuss three methods for estimating the former. Estimating the latter is more challenging, but broad limits to this estimate may be feasible.},

Despite their dependence on host cells, viruses are evolutionarily autonomous, with their own genomes and evolutionary trajectories locked in arms races with the hosts. Here, we discuss a simple functional logic to explain virus macroevolution that appears to deﬁne the course of virus evolution. A small core of virus hallmark genes that are responsible for genome replication apparently descended from primordial replicators, whereas most virus genes, starting with those encoding capsid proteins, were subsequently acquired from hosts. The oldest of these acquisitions antedate the last universal cellular ancestor (LUCA). Host gene capture followed two major routes: convergent recruitment of genes with functions that directly beneﬁt virus reproduction and exaptation when host proteins are repurposed for unique virus functions. These forms of host protein recruitment by viruses result in different levels of similarity between virus and host homologs, with the exapted ones often changing beyond easy recognition.},

Darwinian fitness is an old concept whose quantification dates back to the early developments of population genetics. It was later applied to viruses (mainly to RNA viruses) to quantify relative multiplication capacities of individual mutant clones or complex populations. The present article reviews the fitness concept and its relevance for the understanding of the adaptive dynamics of viruses in constant and changing environments. Many studies have addressed the fitness cost of escape mutations (to antibodies, cytotoxic T cells or inhibitors) as an influence on the efficacy of antiviral interventions.

These viruses replicate with extremely high mutation rates and exhibit significant genetic diversity. This diversity allows a viral population to rapidly adapt to dynamic environments and evolve resistance to vaccines and antiviral drugs. For the last 30 years, quasispecies theory has provided a population-based framework for understanding RNA viral evolution. A quasispecies is a cloud of diverse variants that are genetically linked through mutation, interact cooperatively on a functional level, and collectively contribute to the characteristics of the population. Many predictions of quasispecies theory run counter to traditional views of microbial behavior and evolution and have profound implications for our understanding of viral disease. Here, we discuss basic principles of quasispecies theory and describe its relevance for our understanding of viral fitness, virulence, and antiviral therapeutic strategy.},

The difficulty of using this method of treatment in the case of SARS-CoV-2 is that coronaviruses have an effective mechanism for maintaining genome stability. Its central element is the nsp14 protein, which is characterized by exonuclease activity, due to which incorrectly included and noncanonical nucleotides are removed from the 3' end of the growing RNA chain. Inhibitors of nsp14 exonuclease and nucleoside analogues resistant to its action are viewed as potential targets for anticoronavirus therapy.},

            Most patients failing antiretroviral treatment in Uganda continue to fail their treatment regimen even if a dominant drug-resistant HIV-1 genotype is not detected. In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30\% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64\% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified low-frequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drug-resistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants.},

To understand how RNA viruses are able to jump species boundaries and spread in new hosts it is essential to determine the basic processes of evolutionary change in these infectious agents. RNA virus evolution is largely shaped by very high rates of mutation. This, coupled with potentially enormous intra- and interhost population sizes and continual replication, allows the rapid production of genetic diversity, including those mutations that facilitate host adaptation. However, high mutation rates also act to constrain aspects of RNA virus evolution, as the majority of mutations, including many at synonymous sites, are deleterious, which in turn places an upper limit on genome size. Ironically, although RNA viruses are characterized by their mutation rates, these rates may not be high enough to allow the onset of quasispecies dynamics, in which natural selection acts on the viral population as a whole.},

Thus, it is critical to understand factors that promote or prevent RDV resistance. We passaged SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of RDV. After 13 passages, we isolated three viral lineages with phenotypic resistance as defined by increases in half-maximal effective concentration from 2.7- to 10.4-fold. Sequence analysis identified nonsynonymous mutations in nonstructural protein 12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
              nsp12
              -RdRp): V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I, and C799F/R. Two lineages encoded the S759A substitution at the RdRp Ser
              759
              -Asp-Asp active motif. In one lineage, the V792I substitution emerged first and then combined with S759A. Introduction of S759A and V792I substitutions at homologous
              nsp12
              positions in murine hepatitis virus demonstrated transferability across betacoronaviruses; introduction of these substitutions resulted in up to 38-fold RDV resistance and a replication defect. Biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp encoding S759A demonstrated a roughly 10-fold decreased preference for RDV-triphosphate (RDV-TP) as a substrate, whereas
              nsp12
              -V792I diminished the uridine triphosphate concentration needed to overcome template-dependent inhibition associated with RDV. The in vitro–selected substitutions identified in this study were rare or not detected in the greater than 6 million publicly available
              nsp12
              -RdRp consensus sequences in the absence of RDV selection. The results define genetic and biochemical pathways to RDV resistance and emphasize the need for additional studies to define the potential for emergence of these or other RDV resistance mutations in clinical settings.

              The nucleoside analog remdesivir (RDV) is a mainstay of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it is not clear how SARS-CoV-2 could develop resistance to RDV. Here, Stevens
              et al.
              serially passaged SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of RDV. They found that two mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent nonstructural protein 12 RNA polymerase (
              nsp12
              -RdRp), S759A and V792I, mediated RDV resistance. The authors validated a role for these mutations in mediating RDV resistance by inserting in the
              nsp12
              gene of another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus. Analysis of more than 6 million SARS-CoV-2
              nsp12
              sequences demonstrated that these mutations were rare or not detected. Together, these data demonstrate how RDV resistance may arise.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2, the agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in late 2019 in China, and rapidly spread throughout the world to reach all continents. As the virus expanded in its novel human host, viral lineages diversiﬁed through the accumulation of around two mutations a month on average. Different viral lineages have replaced each other since the start of the pandemic, with the most successful Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants of concern (VoCs) sequentially sweeping through the world to reach high global prevalence. Neither Alpha nor Delta was characterized by strong immune escape, with their success coming mainly from their higher transmissibility. Omicron is far more prone to immune evasion and spread primarily due to its increased ability to (re-)infect hosts with prior immunity. As host immunity reaches high levels globally through vaccination and prior infection, the epidemic is expected to transition from a pandemic regime to an endemic one where seasonality and waning host immunization are anticipated to become the primary forces shaping future SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics. In this review, we consider a body of evidence on the origins, host tropism, epidemiology, genomic and immunogenetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 including an assessment of other coronaviruses infecting humans. Considering what is known so far, we conclude by delineating scenarios for the future dynamic of SARS-CoV-2, ranging from the good—circulation of a ﬁfth endemic ‘common cold’ coronavirus of potentially low virulence, the bad—a situation roughly comparable with seasonal ﬂu, and the ugly—extensive diversiﬁcation into serotypes with long-term high-level endemicity.},

	abstract = {The small size of RNA virus genomes (2-to-32 kb) has been attributed to high mutation rates during replication, which is thought to lack proof-reading. This paradigm is being revisited owing to the discovery of a 39-to-59 exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nidoviruses, a monophyletic group of positive-stranded RNA viruses with a conserved genome architecture. ExoN, a homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes, is exclusively encoded by nidoviruses with genomes larger than 20 kb. All other known non-segmented RNA viruses have smaller genomes. Here we use evolutionary analyses to show that the two- to three-fold expansion of the nidovirus genome was accompanied by a large number of replacements in conserved proteins at a scale comparable to that in the Tree of Life. To unravel common evolutionary patterns in such genetically diverse viruses, we established the relation between genomic regions in nidoviruses in a sequence alignment-free manner. We exploited the conservation of the genome architecture to partition each genome into five non-overlapping regions: 59 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame (ORF) 1a, ORF1b, 39ORFs (encompassing the 39-proximal ORFs), and 39 UTR. Each region was analyzed for its contribution to genome size change under different models. The non-linear model statistically outperformed the linear one and captured .92\% of data variation. Accordingly, nidovirus genomes were concluded to have reached different points on an expansion trajectory dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 39ORFs. Our findings indicate a unidirectional hierarchical relation between these genome regions, which are distinguished by their expression mechanism. In contrast, these regions cooperate bi-directionally on a functional level in the virus life cycle, in which they predominantly control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination, respectively. Collectively, our findings suggest that genome architecture and the associated region-specific division of labor leave a footprint on genome expansion and may limit RNA genome size.},

	abstract = {RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive host environment). A 33.5 kilobase (kb) nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is in the 100–300 kb range. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps towards DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of the size constraints on RNP entities and the role of genome size in virus adaptation. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20–34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with the acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in a monophyletic subset of nidoviruses. However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region including unannotated domains, and overall 41.1-kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, as well as key replicative domains. These domains may include functionally relevant substitutions rarely or never before observed in highly conserved sites of RdRp, NiRAN, ExoN and 3CLpro. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts, e.g. Ankyrin and Fibronectin type II, which might modulate virus-host interactions. PSCNV’s greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features–impressive in themselves–attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.},

Because of its unique ability for the detection of sub-clonal variants within genetically diverse populations, NGS has been successfully applied to analyze and quantify the exceptionally-high diversity within viral quasispecies, and many low-frequency drug- or vaccine-resistant mutations of therapeutic importance have been discovered. Although many works have intensively discussed the latest NGS approaches and applications in general, none of them has focused on applying NGS in viral quasispecies studies, mostly due to the limited ability of current NGS technologies to accurately detect and quantify rare viral variants. Here, we summarize several error-correction strategies that have been developed to enhance the detection accuracy of minority variants. We also discuss critical considerations for preparing a sequencing library from viral RNAs and for analyzing NGS data to unravel the mutational landscape.},

	abstract = {The error rate displayed during template copying to produce viral RNA progeny is a biologically relevant parameter of the replication complexes of viruses. It has consequences for virus–host interactions, and it represents the ﬁrst step in the diversiﬁcation of viruses in nature. Measurements during infections and with puriﬁed viral polymerases indicate that mutation rates for RNA viruses are in the range of 10−3 to 10−6 copying errors per nucleotide incorporated into the nascent RNA product. Although viruses are thought to exploit high error rates for adaptation to changing environments, some of them possess misincorporation correcting activities. One of them is a proofreading-repair 3 to 5 exonuclease present in coronaviruses that may decrease the error rate during replication. Here we review experimental evidence and models of information maintenance that explain why elevated mutation rates have been preserved during the evolution of RNA (and some DNA) viruses. The models also offer an interpretation of why error correction mechanisms have evolved to maintain the stability of genetic information carried out by large viral RNA genomes such as the coronaviruses.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been raging globally for over 2 years with no end in sight. It has become clear that this virus possesses enormous genetic plasticity, and it will not be eradicated. Under increasing selective pressure from population immunity, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has driven it towards greater infectivity, and evasion of humoral and cellular immunity. Omicron and its expanding army of subvariants and recombinants have impaired vaccine protection and made most antibody drugs obsolete. Antiviral drugs, though presently effective, may select for more resistant strains over time. It may be inevitable, then, that future SARS-CoV-2 variants will be immune to our current virusdirected countermeasures. Thus, to gain control over the virus, we need to adopt a new paradigm in searching for next-generation countermeasures and develop host-directed therapeutics (HDTx) and host-directed antivirals (HDA). Different from the virus-directed countermeasures, HDTx and HDA may offer variant agnostic treatment to reduce the risk and severity of infections. In addition, they may exert more uniform effects against the genetically diverse SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies, thereby diminishing the risk of selecting resistant variants. Some promising HDTx and HDA approaches are summarized here.},

The key influences of quasispecies theory on experimental virology have been: (1) to disclose the mutant spectrum nature of viral populations and to evaluate its consequences; (2) to unveil collective properties of genome ensembles that can render a mutant spectrum a unit of selection; and (3) to identify new vulnerability points of pathogenic RNA viruses on three fronts: the need to apply multiple selective constraints (in the form of drug combinations) to minimize selection of treatment-escape variants, to translate the error threshold concept into antiviral designs, and to construct attenuated vaccine viruses through alterations of viral polymerase copying fidelity or through displacements of viral genomes towards unfavorable regions of sequence space. These three major influences on the understanding of viral pathogens preceded extensions of quasispecies to non-viral systems such as bacterial and tumor cell collectivities and prions.
