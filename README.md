During this century, there have been three global health alerts caused by the 
emergence of new zoonotic coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory 
infections: SARS-CoV (2002), MERS-CoV (2012) and SARS-CoV-2 (2019). In response 
to the possible emergence of future pandemic coronaviruses, the development of 
multiple antiviral therapies that target conserved viral characteristics which 
can be used in combination is highlighted as the most effective first line of 
therapeutic defence. In this context, this Final Degree Project analyses the 
evolution and structure of two key proteins in the replication and
transcription complex of coronaviruses, nsp14 and nsp16, as well as the cofactor 
they share, nsp10. The conserved regions of the latter could be key to the 
design of pseudoligands that help to stop the infectious cycle of coronaviruses 
in humans.
